Mopidy added an :ref:`HTTP frontend <http-frontend>` in 0.10 which provides the
building blocks needed for creating web clients for Mopidy with the help of a
WebSocket and a JavaScript library provided by Mopidy.

This page will list any HTTP/web Mopidy clients. If you've created one, please
notify us so we can include your client on this page.

See :ref:`http-frontend` for details on how to build your own web client.

The first web client for Mopidy is still under development, but is already very
usable. It targets both desktop and mobile browsers.

To try it out, get a copy of https://github.com/woutervanwijk/Mopidy-WebClient
and point the :attr:`mopidy.settings.HTTP_SERVER_STATIC_DIR` setting towards
your copy of the web client.
